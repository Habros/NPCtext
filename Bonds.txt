I must never be seen or found by the law
My family is fallen royalty and I must restore our name
I stole something years ago and still feel guilty
I recently stole something and feel terrible about it
I owe everything to a person I hate
I save every copper to buy back the ancestral orchard
I am guilty of a horrible crime and must redeem myself
Someone was seriously hurt because of my mistake
Someone was killed because of my mistake

Hard work is its own reward
I need to get wealthy enough to attract the attention of my true love
Nothing is more important to me than the members of my club
Nothing is more important to me than my childhood friends
I must suffer in silence
I can never reveal my love for the son of a local lord
I can never reveal my love for the daughter of a local lord
I carry a secret that I believe could ruin the world
I will face any challenge to win my mothers approval
I will face any challenge to win my familys approval
I need people to see me as a hero
I need people to look up to me
I will always remmeber my first love
Bandits murdered my family and I must have revenge
A noble carelessly murdered my family and I must have revenge
My honor is the most important thing I have
I give to the orphanage so other wont suffer as I suffered
I owe my survival to another orphan who helped me
I can always learn something from the strangers I meet
There is always more to learn
I must always respect other peoples beliefs and customs
I must always be on guard
Do unto others as you would have done to you
I trust only myself
